# üí´ About Me:
Hello, my name is Ayman Sulaiman and I am a data engineering professional with a passion for innovation and a drive to improve healthcare outcomes. With 3 years of experience in the tech industry, I have become a master of data management, processing, and analysis. I am skilled in Python, SQL, and Scala, and able to turn complex data sets into actionable insights. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning Rust, a programming language known for its performance and memory safety. I am not just a data engineer, but also a problem solver and a team player who is always looking for ways to improve and optimize the data process. I am the perfect addition to any team looking to make the most out of their data.
